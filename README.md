# C-Journey

This repo is where I collect my C programming exercises and homework. Nothing too professional â€” just a place to keep track of my learning.

## Folders

- `exercises/` â€“ Small practice files and experiments
- `homework/` â€“ Assignments from courses or tutorials
- `weekly-examples` â€“ Weekly examples organized by week  

## Why?

I'm learning C and wanted a simple way to organize what I write. Maybe one day this will grow into something bigger â€” who knows.

## Note

Code might be a bit messy or incomplete... because why not ðŸ™‚
